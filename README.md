## Tasks

Configuration as Code(CasC) is becoming the way to maintain all your infrastructure. 

This Presentation/lab will provide code to demonstrate how to use CasC to maintain all aspects of AAP. The provided code will be a starting point, and will guide the user through how to utilize the code, and make it their own. This session will cover configuring controller, private automation hub, execution environments, and custom collections as well as the creation of workflows without the GUI as an example to follow along. These principles will help to prevent drift in configuration, allow changes to require approval before implementation, and help to maintain both a development and prod deployment.
