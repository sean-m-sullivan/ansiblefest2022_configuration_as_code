# Intro

In this section, you will only be given a summary of the objects you need to create along with some screenshots of a controller that is configured with the completed code. You will also be provided the variables sections from the readme's for each of the required roles to help you complete this task.

## Step 1

Create a file `group_vars/all/projects.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_projects` to configure the UI to look like the screenshot.

### What git project are we pointing at

```yaml
---
controller_projects:

...
```

![project](assets/images/projects.png)

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- [projects role](https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/projects/README.md)

## Step 2

Create a file `group_vars/all/credential_types.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_credential_types` to create also credential type called `automation_hub` with the values from the screenshot.

Make sure to keep the ssh_priv_file credential type.

{% raw %}

```yaml
---
controller_credential_types:
  - name: ssh_priv_file
    kind: cloud
    description: creates temp ssh priv key to use (cannot have passphrase)
    inputs:
      fields:
        - id: priv_key
          type: string
          label: Certificate
          format: ssh_private_key
          multiline: true
          secret: true
    injectors:
      env:
        MY_CERT_FILE_PATH: !unsafe '{{ tower.filename.cert_file }}'
      file:
        template.cert_file: !unsafe '{{ priv_key }}'
...
```

{% endraw %}

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- [credential types role](https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/credential_types/README.md)

## Step 3

Create a file `group_vars/all/credentials.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_credentials` to configure the UI to look like the screenshot

{% raw %}

```yaml
---
controller_credentials:
  - name: aap_admin
    credential_type: Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
    organization: config_as_code
    description: aap admin account
    inputs:
      host: "{{ controller_hostname }}"
      username: "{{ controller_username }}"
      password: "{{ controller_password }}"
      verify_ssl: false

  - name: ah_token_user
    credential_type: automation_hub
    organization: config_as_code
    description: automation hub api account
    inputs:
      hostname: "{{ ah_host }}"
      username: "{{ ah_token_username }}"
      token: "{{ ah_token }}"
      verify_ssl: false

  - name: ah_certified
    credential_type: Ansible Galaxy/Automation Hub API Token
    organization: config_as_code
    inputs:
      url: "https://{{ ah_host }}/api/galaxy/content/rh-certified/"
      token: "{{ ah_token }}"

  - name: ah_published
    credential_type: Ansible Galaxy/Automation Hub API Token
    organization: config_as_code
    inputs:
      url: "https://{{ ah_host }}/api/galaxy/content/published/"
      token: "{{ ah_token }}"

  - name: ah_community
    credential_type: Ansible Galaxy/Automation Hub API Token
    organization: config_as_code
    inputs:
      url: "https://{{ ah_host }}/api/galaxy/content/community/"
      token: "{{ ah_token }}"

  - name: cr_ah
    credential_type: Container Registry
    organization: config_as_code
    inputs:
      host: "{{ ah_host }}"
      username: "{{ ah_username }}"
      password: "{{ ah_password }}"
      verify_ssl: false

# might need to change for the student account
  - name: root
    credential_type: Machine
    organization: config_as_code
    description: root local password
    inputs:
      username: root
      password: "{{ root_machine_pass }}"

  - name: vault
    credential_type: Vault
    organization: config_as_code
    description: vault password
    inputs:
      vault_password: "{{ vault_pass }}"
...
```

{% endraw %}

![credential](assets/images/cred_ah_admin.png)
![add github screenshot](assets/images/cred_github.png)

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- [credentials role](https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/credentials/README.md)

## Step 4

Create a file `group_vars/all/inventories.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_inventories` to configure the UI to look like the screenshot

```yaml
---
controller_inventories:

...
```

![inventory](assets/images/inventory.png)

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- [inventories role](https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/inventories/README.md)

## Step 5

Create a file `group_vars/all/inventory_sources.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_inventory_sources` to configure the UI to look like the screenshot
**WE never declared an inventory files here yet, and never declared the env variable**

```yaml
---
controller_inventory_sources:

...
```

![inventory_source](assets/images/inventory_source.png)

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- [inventory sources role](https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/inventory_sources/README.md)

## Step 6

Create a file `group_vars/all/job_templates.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_templates` to configure the UI to look like the screenshot

Pay attention to the credentials attached to each job template.

**remove labels from the example for build_execution_environment image**
**need example project to test this as job templates not matching playbook causing failure**

```yaml
---
controller_templates:

...
```

![job_template_ee](assets/images/jt_build_ee.png)
![job_template_custom_collections](assets/images/jt_custom_collections.png)
![job_template_ah_config](assets/images/jt_ah_config.png)
![job_template_controller_config](assets/images/jt_controller_config.png)

Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:

- [job templates role](https://github.com/redhat-cop/controller_configuration/blob/devel/roles/job_templates/README.md)

## Step 7

Create a playbook `controller_config.yml`

{% raw %}

```yaml
---

  hosts: automationcontroller
  gather_facts: false
  vars_files:
    - "vault.yml"

          register: r_ah_token

        - name: Fixing format

          when: r_ah_token['changed']
      when: ah_token is not defined or ah_token['token'] is defined

    - name: include credential_types role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:

      when: controller_credential_types is defined

    - name: include credential role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:

    - name: include projects role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:

      when: controller_inventories is defined

    - name: include inventory_sources role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: redhat_cop.controller_configuration.inventory_sources
      when: controller_inventory_sources is defined

    - name: include inventory_source_update role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: redhat_cop.controller_configuration.inventory_source_update

    - name: include groups role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:

{% endraw %}

Use these options to run the playbook in the execution environment.

```console
ansible-navigator run controller_config.yml --eei hub-student1.rhd817.example.opentlc.com/config_as_code -i inventory.yml -l automationcontroller --pa='--tls-verify=false' -m stdout
```
